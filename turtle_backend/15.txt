William's country was at war with another nation. His parents were conscripted to participate in the war. William and his older sister managed to live off the money saved by their parents and what they earned themselves. As the war continued, it became inevitable that William would eventually be drafted. Currently, William is in the sixth grade of elementary school. He may not be drafted right now, but it won't be long before he is. His sister believed that, without proper training, William would be quickly killed in the war. Therefore, she did not want her brother to be sent to the battlefield. After much contemplation, William's sister decided to act on a plan. She began to physically abuse William sometimes beating him, kicking him, or whipping him. Each act of abuse tore her heart apart, but she persevered, apologizing to him silently many times over. As time went on, William turned fifteen. Predictably, the war showed no signs of ending. At this rate, it wouldn't be strange for William to be drafted anytime soon. With that thought, the sister decided to implement the final step of her plan. She stabbed William's legs with a knife, rendering them immobile. If he couldn't move his legs, he wouldn't be drafted. She had continuously abused him to avoid suspicion, fearing that an abrupt injury might lead them both to be arrested for lacking "patriotism". After stabbing his legs, she was arrested by the police. As she was being taken away, she looked at her brother's face, twisted in agony. Later, William, clutching his wounded legs, wept as he read her diary detailing all these events. Eventually, the war ended. William was not drafted. To this day, he waits for the return of his parents and sister. William is younger than William's sister.
