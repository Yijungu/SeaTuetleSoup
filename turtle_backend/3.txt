Helen was taking a listening comprehension test. So, she was listening to the listening test radio that was being played in the examination room. From the radio, she heard two telephone connection sounds, followed by a woman’s voice over the phone.:
"Hello! This is Hackers Restaurant."
"Hello. Can I reserve a private room for Christmas dinner?"
"I am sorry. On Christmas Day, we only accept reservations for lunch at the moment."
"Then I will make a reservation for lunch. Can I use the discount coupon I received from the application?"
"Of course….."
Helen could infer the answer by listening up to this point. So, she stopped listening and drew lines through everything she had jotted down, erasing it all.
