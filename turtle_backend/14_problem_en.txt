James has obsessive-compulsive disorder, so he installed CCTV in front of his new apartment door. Every day after work, James would rewind and watch the footage. Today, he called a housekeeper to clean his house, so he checked the footage even more carefully. The first scene in the video showed the housekeeper leaving her own house and taking the elevator down. At that moment, James froze and couldn't move. What happened?
