Two friends, Thomas and Robert, embarked on a chilling adventure, venturing to a decrepit cabin nestled in the heart of the mountains. Their goal was to immerse themselves in an isolated and somewhat eerie environment, testing their courage. However, their adventure quickly turned into a nightmare when they became trapped in the cabin due to a sudden landslide.
Days rolled into nights, and the hope of rescue began to dim. Desperation began to claw at their minds, and in an effort to find anything useful, they stumbled upon an old gun with a single bullet in a hidden drawer of a dusty room.
Realizing the harsh reality of their survival being almost impossible, they devised a grim plan. They would play a card game, the loser of which would be granted the privilege to end their suffering first with the gun.
In the end, the winner, Robert, chose the bullet, preferring to die swiftly rather than endure the agony of slow starvation. After pulling the trigger, Robert's lifeless body fell to the ground, the gun still in his hand.
Thomas, the loser, had nothing but time and hunger. He died slowly, a painful death from starvation. His last possession, a single playing card, lay next to his lifeless body. He died with the cruel irony of being the loser of a game where winning meant dying first.
Eventually, in a room filled with the eerie silence of death, two men were found - Robert with a pistol in his hand and Thomas with a playing card next to his body. The card was a symbol of their last game, a deadly game that dictated their tragic end.
