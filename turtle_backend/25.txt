A man named Smith visited a revolving sushi restaurant where he enjoyed a hearty meal. After finishing his meal, he managed to discreetly slip the empty, more expensive plates that had once held his food into his bag. Not only had he devoured his meal, but he had also stolen the plates without the server noticing.
 The plate was empty after finishing the food. He then cunningly paid the restaurant only for the cheaper sushi, deceiving them out of the full amount due. As soon as he stepped outside, Smith immediately disposed of the stolen plates to avoid any chance of being caught.
