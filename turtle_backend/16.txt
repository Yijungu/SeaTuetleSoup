The Simpson family was crossing the desert in a hot air balloon. However, they soon realized that the balloon was slowly leaking air, causing it to gradually descend. In an attempt to slow down the descent, they threw out their belongings and even their clothes, but it wasn't enough. Eventually, they decided that one of them would have to jump. Feeling the most responsible and being the heaviest, the father, Simpson, leaped from the balloon. Thanks to his sacrifice, the rest of the family landed safely at a reduced speed. Simpson was later found dead, naked in the middle of the desert.
