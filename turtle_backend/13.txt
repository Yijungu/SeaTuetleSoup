Chloe was playing a board game called Blue Marble with her friends. "Blue Marble" is a game in which you roll the dice to buy real estate while moving the player's play space, and if another player stops in that space, you get a rental fee. As the game neared its end, Chloe was facing a real estate space where a friend spent a lot of money building a hotel. When Chloe rolls the dice and stops in that space, she has to pay a big rent to her friend. As a result, Chloe may have to pay all of her funds. In this situation, Chloe was facing the hotel and agonizing over what strategy to take.
