Once a wise and affectionate older sister of William. However, after our parents left, she started to abuse William. As he grew older, the abuse got worse. Eventually, she stabbed me with a knife. She was immediately caught by the police.
"Why did you do such a thing.."
Later, William found his sister's diary. After reading it, he couldn't hold back his tears.
What was the content of the diary?
