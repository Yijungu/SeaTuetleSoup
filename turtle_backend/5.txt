Charlie is working as a baker in prison.
Charlie was given a special order.
In the past, inmates often stocked up on bread little by little over several days to use it as emergency food for escape attempts.
So when Charlie made the bread, he added an ingredient that molds after three days.
As a result, it became impossible to stock up on bread, and the number of escaped prisoners decreased.
