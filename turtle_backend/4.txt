A woman named Julie, who was the mother, and a male child named Andy were involved in an incident where a sharp instrument cut a part of their bodies simultaneously. Andy had just come out of Julie's womb. Henderson, the obstetrician, was the one who made the cut. Although he had cut a part of both Julie's and Andy's bodies, Henderson did not face any punishment. The reason for this was that he had cut the umbilical cord, using a sharp pair of scissors for the purpose. Since it was a standard medical procedure, there was no cause for concern or punishment. Henderson utilized the scissors to sever the connection between Julie and her male child, Andy, completing the birth process.
