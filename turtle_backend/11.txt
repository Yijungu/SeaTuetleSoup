Chris had the ability to see the age at which people would die. While on the subway, he felt uneasy and asked one passenger, "Are you 22 years old?" The passenger replied, "Yes, that's correct." Chris then turned to another person and asked, "Are you 50 years old?" That passenger also confirmed it was true. Upon hearing their responses, Chris was terrified. The ages he was seeing matched their current ages. He realized that there would soon be an accident on the subway, resulting in the death of everyone on board. The ages he saw were the ages at which these people would die, and since their current ages matched, he understood that they were all about to die.
