A man named James was piloting his private airplane when he encountered a serious problem with the engine. As the plane began to plummet from the sky, this trouble made it impossible for him to control the plane, and he decided on an emergency escape. James quickly grabbed the backpack he had prepared for emergencies and leaped into the sky. He was ready to pull the cord on his parachute and pulled the string in his backpack. However, he realized that in his haste, he had taken the wrong bag, and instead of a parachute, a packed lunch emerged. The moment he saw the lunchbox, James realized the dreadful fact that he was going to die.
